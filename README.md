## Hint:

- You can 'download', 'clone' the repo.
  to use clone type this in your cmd/terminal

```bash
git clone <the repocitory url>
```

eg:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aruncs31s/level_0
```

- If you download code from GitHub, remember the word download, it does not downloads the `.git` folder

## Summary

- Repo: Repo Means a kind of folder, but it will have the .git folder.
- repo short for Repository
- "."(dot) infont of a folder means it's hidden
- When you download a repo from GitHub it will not contain the `.git` folder

> [!CAUTION]
> `Download` and `clone` are not same

## FAQ:

1. Why there is a dot(.) in front of the .git folder
   Ans: The . or dot, means it is a hidden folder.

2. Where will be the 'download' thing in the https://github.com site
   Ans: If you open a repository (from now on we call repository as repo)
   you will see a dropdown at the top right named "Code",
   click on that and then you will see two tabs "Local" and "CodeSpaces"
   and then you will see "Clone" and "Download Zip" option
